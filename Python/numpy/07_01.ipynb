    "\n",
    "NumPy aims to provide an array object that is up to 50x faster than traditional Python lists.\n",

    "The array object in NumPy is called ndarray, it provides a lot of supporting functions that make working with ndarray very easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Arrays are very frequently used in data science, where speed and resources are very important."

    "* **Written in C** and **up to 100 times faster than lists**.\n",
    "* Critical in big-data processing, AI applications and much more. \n",
    "* According to `libraries.io`, **over 450 Python libraries depend on NumPy**. \n",
    "* Many popular data science libraries such as Pandas, SciPy (Scientific Python) and Keras (for deep learning) are built on or depend on NumPy. "

    "\n",
    "This behavior is called locality of reference in computer science.\n",
